### 🧠 Introduction  

The **Phishing Attack Simulation and Detection** project is designed to **simulate real-world phishing attacks** and build **defensive detection systems**.  
It helps understand how phishing emails and fake websites trick users, and how automated detection systems (like email filters & URL scanners) can be implemented in Python to mitigate risks.

### 📦 Features  

- 🎭 **Phishing Attack Simulation** – Generate demo phishing emails/websites to test awareness.  
- 📧 **Email Filter** – Detect suspicious email headers & malicious links.  
- 🌐 **Fake Website Detection** – Identify and block suspicious/phishing URLs.  
- 🛡️ **Awareness Training** – Educate users on recognizing phishing attempts.  
- ⚙️ **Customizable Scripts** – Extend with your own phishing & detection logic.
